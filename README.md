# Kaprekar's Constant

This script demonstrates the process of reaching Kaprekar's constant (6174) through a series of iterations using a four-digit number. 

## How It Works

1. The user inputs a four-digit number (with at least two different digits).
2. The script rearranges the digits to create the largest and smallest possible numbers.
3. The smallest number is subtracted from the largest.
4. This process is repeated until the result is 6174.
5. The script prints each iteration and the total number of iterations taken to reach 6174.

### Input Requirements

- The input number must be a four-digit number.
- The number must contain at least two different digits (i.e., it cannot be a repdigit like 1111).

### Example

For example, if the input number is `3524`, the output will show the iterations leading to Kaprekar's constant:
